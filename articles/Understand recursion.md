Recursion, simply put, is calling a function on itself. It can used to break down complex problems into smaller manageable similar units that can be handled by the same function.

## Recursion vs Iteration

An iterative function is one that loops to repeat some part of the code, and a recursive function is one that **calls itself** again to repeat the code.

E.g To calculate the sum of an array of numbers

```javascript
function iterativeSum(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i of arr) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}

function recursiveSum(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  return arr[0] + recursiveSum(arr.slice(1));
}

/**
 *
 * iterativeSum([1,2,3]) => 1 + 2 + 3 => 6
 *
 * recursiveSum([1,2,3])
 *     => 1 + recursiveSum([2,3])
 *     =>       2 + recursiveSum([3])
 *     =>           3 + recursiveSum([])
 *     =>               0
 *     => 0 + 3 + 2 + 1 => 6
 */

console.log(iterativeSum([1, 2, 3])); //6
console.log(recursiveSum([1, 2, 3])); //6
```

## How to use recursion

### base condition is a must

Using recursion without a base condition leads to infinite recursion. As recursion is calling the function on itself, base condition indicates when to terminate the process.

```javascript
function infiniteRecursion() {
  // keeps calling itself without termination
  return infiniteRecursion();
}
```

### break down the problem into smaller units that can be handled by the function itself.

E.g.

_the sum of_ an array = the value of first element + _the sum of_ the rest of array.

That's how we do it recursively in _recursiveSum_ example above.

## Practices make perfect

### Q1

#### Question:

By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers can be produced. Write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produce that number.

#### Thoughts:

To find a solution for a number(let's call it _A_), we tries adding 5 or multiplying 3 to the current number(let's call it _B_) and use recursion to
check if there is a solution for the result(i.e. _B + 5_ or _B \* 3_). The base condition is when the current number is greater than(boom!) or equal to(solution found!) _A_.

#### Solution:

```javascript
function findSolution(num) {
  function find(start, history) {
    if (start > num) {
      return null; // boom!
    } else if (start === num) {
      return history; //solution found
    }
    return (
      find(start + 5, `(${history} + 5)`) || find(start * 3, `(${history} * 3)`)
    );
  }

  return find(1, "1");
}

console.log(findSolution(13)); //(((1 * 3) + 5) + 5)
console.log(findSolution(20)); //null
```

### Q2

- Question: [Inorder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)(Left, Right, Top) traversal of binary tree

- Solution

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value, left = null, right = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function inorder(node, fn) {
  if (node == null) {
    return;
  }
  inorder(node.left, fn);
  fn(node);
  inorder(node.right, fn);
}

function test() {
  /**
   *        A
   *      /   \
   *    B       C
   *   / \       \
   *  E   F       H
   */
  let E = new Node("E"),
    F = new Node("F"),
    H = new Node("H"),
    B = new Node("B", E, F),
    C = new Node("C", null, H),
    A = new Node("A", B, C);
  inorder(A, node => console.log(node.value)); // E B F A C H
}
test();
```
